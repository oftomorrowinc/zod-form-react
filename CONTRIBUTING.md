## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your contribution
4. Make your changes
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zod-form-react.git
cd zod-form-react

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development mode
npm run dev

# Run the example app
npm run demo
```

### Firebase Emulators

For testing Firebase features locally:

```bash
# Start Firebase emulators
npm run emulators

# In another terminal, run the example
npm run demo
```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**: Write your code following our coding standards

3. **Add Tests**: Ensure your changes are covered by tests

4. **Update Documentation**: Update the README.md if you're adding new features

5. **Check Your Code**: Run all checks before committing
   ```bash
   npm run check
   ```

## Testing

We use Jest for testing. Please ensure all tests pass:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/utils/schema-parser.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files next to the code they test with a `.test.ts` extension
- Write descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock Firebase services when testing Firebase features

Example test structure:
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render without errors', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle user interaction correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Update Your Branch**: Rebase your branch on the latest main
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run All Checks**: Ensure everything passes
   ```bash
   npm run check
   npm test
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Push Your Changes**: Push to your fork
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**: Go to GitHub and create a pull request with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description of what was changed and why
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper types, avoid `any` when possible
- Export types from `types/` directory
- Use generics for reusable components

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the existing theme structure
- Keep dark mode in mind
- Use CSS variables for theme values

### Code Style

- We use Prettier for formatting (runs automatically)
- ESLint for linting
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Git Commits

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commits format:
  ```
  feat: add new feature
  fix: resolve bug in component
  docs: update README
  test: add tests for utils
  refactor: improve code structure
  ```
